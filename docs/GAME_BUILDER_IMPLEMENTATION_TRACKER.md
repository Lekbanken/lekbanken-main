# Game Builder Implementation Tracker

**Started:** 2026-01-24  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-24  
**Status:** Phase 2 Complete ✅

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the Game Builder improvements based on the inventory and roadmap defined in [GAME_BUILDER_INVENTORY_AND_ROADMAP.md](./GAME_BUILDER_INVENTORY_AND_ROADMAP.md).

The implementation follows a hybrid "Outline as source + Flow as visualization" approach where:
- **Phases remain containers** with steps nested inside
- **Triggers create the real edges** visualized as connections
- **Editing happens via structured forms** with visual overview for understanding

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: State Refactor + Undo/Redo ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Clean up before adding new features - extract builder state to a hook with reducer-based history.

| Task | Status | Files | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Create GameBuilderState types | ✅ Done | [types/game-builder-state.ts](../types/game-builder-state.ts) | All state types, actions, defaults |
| Create useGameBuilder hook | ✅ Done | [hooks/useGameBuilder.ts](../hooks/useGameBuilder.ts) | ~470 lines with full undo/redo |
| Integrate hook into GameBuilderPage | ✅ Done | [GameBuilderPage.tsx](../app/admin/games/builder/GameBuilderPage.tsx) | Replaced 15+ useState calls |
| Add keyboard shortcuts | ✅ Done | GameBuilderPage.tsx | Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z (redo) |
| Fix SessionControlPanel status | ✅ Done | [SessionControlPanel.tsx](../components/play/SessionControlPanel.tsx) | Added 'draft' and 'lobby' status badges |

**Technical Details:**
- History pattern: `past/present/future` arrays with MAX_HISTORY_SIZE = 50
- Committing actions: ADD/DELETE/REORDER commit immediately
- Non-committing actions: SET actions use debounced commits (800ms)
- stateRef for accessing current state in callbacks (avoids stale closure issues)

### Phase 1: MVP Overview Tab ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add "Översikt" section with static visualization of game structure.

| Task | Status | Files | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Add 'oversikt' to BuilderSectionNav | ✅ Done | [BuilderSectionNav.tsx](../app/admin/games/builder/components/BuilderSectionNav.tsx) | MapIcon, second in nav order |
| Create deriveOverviewGraph helper | ✅ Done | [overview/deriveOverviewGraph.ts](../app/admin/games/builder/components/overview/deriveOverviewGraph.ts) | ~400 lines, extracts nodes/edges |
| Create GameOverview component | ✅ Done | [overview/GameOverview.tsx](../app/admin/games/builder/components/overview/GameOverview.tsx) | ~650 lines with SVG edges |
| Create overview index exports | ✅ Done | [overview/index.ts](../app/admin/games/builder/components/overview/index.ts) | Exports GameOverview + utilities |
| Add GameOverview to components index | ✅ Done | [components/index.ts](../app/admin/games/builder/components/index.ts) | Added export |
| Wire GameOverview in page render | ✅ Done | GameBuilderPage.tsx | Renders when activeSection === 'oversikt' |
| Add translations (sv/en/no) | ✅ Done | messages/*.json | `admin.games.builder.overview.*` namespace |

**Component Structure:**
```
GameOverview
├── PhaseContainer - Renders phases with nested steps
│   └── StepNode - Individual step display
├── OrphanStepsContainer - Steps without a phase
├── ArtifactNode - Artifact display  
├── EdgesSvg - SVG overlay for trigger edges
│   └── TriggerEdgeLabel - Unresolved warning icons
├── Legend - Color coding explanation
└── Quick Stats Grid - Counts for phases/steps/artifacts/triggers
```

**Features Implemented:**
- Phases as containers with steps nested inside
- Orphan steps (no phase) displayed separately
- Artifacts section at bottom
- Triggers summary with quick navigation buttons
- SVG curved edges for trigger relationships with arrowheads
- Click-to-navigate on any node (opens respective editor section)

- Legend for node/edge colors
- Quick stats grid (phase/step/artifact/trigger counts)
- Empty state with call-to-action buttons

### Phase 2: React Flow Integration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Replace simple SVG with React Flow for better UX (pan/zoom/minimap).

| Task | Status | Files | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Install @xyflow/react | ✅ Done | package.json | React Flow v12 library |

**Technical Details:**
- Uses @xyflow/react v12 (React Flow)
- Custom nodes: PhaseNode (blue), StepNode (emerald), ArtifactNode (amber)
- Custom edges: TriggerEdge with curved bezier paths, unresolved warnings
- MiniMap: Color-coded by node type (phase/step/artifact)
- Controls: Zoom in/out/fit, pan with drag

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 0
- [x] All useState calls migrated to useGameBuilder hook
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] Undo/redo keyboard shortcuts work (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- [x] Autosave still functions
- [ ] Manual test: Create new game, edit all sections
- [ ] Manual test: Edit existing game, verify state loads

### Phase 1
- [x] 'Översikt' visible in navigation
- [x] GameOverview renders without errors
- [x] Translations load correctly (sv/en/no)
- [ ] Manual test: Create game with phases/steps, verify visualization
- [ ] Manual test: Click nodes to navigate to editors
- [ ] Manual test: Add triggers, verify edges appear

## ChatGPT Feedback Applied

From the user's ChatGPT conversation, the following feedback was incorporated:

| Feedback | Applied |
|----------|---------|
| History should be 50-100 states, not 20 | ✅ MAX_HISTORY_SIZE = 50 |
| Commit-actions save directly, text debounced | ✅ Committing vs non-committing actions |
| Zod: start minimal | ⏳ Deferred to later phase |
| React Flow in Phase 2, not Phase 1 | ✅ Phase 1 uses simple SVG |
| Avoid paid React Flow features | ✅ Noted in Phase 2 requirements |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Phase 1**: Manually verify the overview visualization works
2. **Decide on Phase 2**: Evaluate if React Flow is needed or if SVG is sufficient
3. **Address real-time validation**: High priority from gap analysis
4. **Continue to Phase 2**: If React Flow integration is desired

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Hybrid Outline + Flow Visualization ✅
- Phases as containers (not nodes in pure graph)
- Triggers create the real edges
- Edit via forms, visualize via overview

### Decision 2: Reducer with History Pattern ✅
- useReducer with past/present/future arrays
- Committing vs non-committing actions
- Debounced commits for text fields

### Decision 3: SVG for Phase 1 ✅
- Simple flex layout with SVG overlay
- React Flow deferred to Phase 2
- Avoid over-engineering initial implementation
